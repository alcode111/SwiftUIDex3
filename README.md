## Description

The Dex3 app is a SwiftUI application that provides information about various Pokemon species - 3 generations, exactly 386 Pokemons -, enabling users to explore and learn about their favorite Pokemons.


## Features

- **Pokedex & Pokemon Display**: View details and attributes of different Pokemons, including their types, abilities, and base stats.
- **Chart**: The stats are displayed using the Chart framework.
- **Favorites**: Mark Pokemon as favorites to easily access them later.
- **Data Persistence**: the Pokemons are fetched from an API at first, and then stored using Core Data.

## Stretch Goals

- **iOS17 Compatibility**: Plan to update the app to support the latest iOS17 features and enhancements.
- **Swift Data**: Plan to update the app to Swift Data.
- **Search**: Add the ability to search for Pokemons in the Pokedex via a search bar.

## Technologies Used

- **Core Data**: Utilizes Core Data for efficient data management and persistence within the app.
- **API**: Utilizes a Pokemon API to fetch a selection of Pokemons, seamlessly integrated within the ViewModel and FetchController components.
- **Xcode**: Developed within Xcode, an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS containing a suite of software development tools.
- **Swift**: Implemented using Swift, a versatile and powerful programming language for iOS and macOS development.
- **SwiftUI**: Employs SwiftUI for building dynamic and engaging user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
